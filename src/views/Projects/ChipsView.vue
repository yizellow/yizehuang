        Trump enters his second term as president facing an unprecedented
        combination of targeted cyber and physical threats. China has tried to
        hack the communications of Trump and his inner circle. Iran has
        allegedly tried to kill him. And during the campaign, Trump survived two
        separate assassination attempts. Unwelcome guests have been a security
        issue before at Mar-a-Lago. Since July, a Chinese national has been
        arrested multiple times for trying to get onto the property. Yet sources
        told CNN that there’s only so much they can do to ratchet up security
        there. “We can’t put him in a bubble,” one Secret Service official told
        CNN, adding that “everyone’s waiting” to see what the coming presidency
        will look like and what security challenges lay ahead.
